# Python-Check-Generate-Password

## What is it?
this is a password checker and generator, written entirely in python and this was the year 11 GCSE computer science coursework before it was removed due to the incompetence of the exam board, read more about it on: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/11/27/coursework-computer-science-gcse-set-dropped-amid-fears-widespread/

## What does it check for?
in order for the password to be validated it must be:
- over 10 characters
- must have lowercase characters
- must have uppercase characters
- must contain atleast one number
- must have special characters (!#@Â£$)
- and cannot contain a whitespace character

for password generation, a randomized string with 20 letters is generated using list_of_chars as characters for use
